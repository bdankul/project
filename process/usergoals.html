        <h1>User Goal's</h1>
        
        <h2>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h2>
        <p>User’s will understand the content because there should be an introductory tutorial/introduction when they first use the project. Tool tips will also play an important role in the beginning.</p>
        
        <h2>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h2>
        <p>User’s will be enticed to use the project by our advertisements showing off the features of the program. Anyone who’s primary objective matches ours (help achieving goals) will use the program.</p>
        
        <h2>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h2>
        <p>The main feature to make this project work is a calendar. A calendar that the user can input their event details in and set an alarm to be alerted. The alert system also needs to be attention grabbing and be able to work offline. The project must be useable on desktop and mobile devices. </p>
