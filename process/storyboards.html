        <p>This story starts off showing three different people in three different scenarios. The top shows a student biking home from school, the middle shows a student relaxing at their desk, and the third shows a student walking joyously as they listen to music. All three are relaxed and happy because they believe they are all done with their work. Then, reality strikes them and they remember that they actually do have more work due the next day. After that, it shows a student stressed out working all night. The end message would be, "don't let this happen to you." "Never forget anything again... Task manager!" </p>

            <h2>Board 2</h2>
            <img src="storyboard2.jpeg" width="600" height="501" alt="storyboard 2"></figure>
        <p>This story starts off showing the first day of class and the overwhelming amount of information given that day. It then goes to show how stressed a person can become from worrying about all that work and information. "Introducing.. Task Manager!" The story then goes to illustrate how this project can be useful and fun for a user. The first box shows how a student would input all the dates from the syllabus into the app on a mobile device the first day in order to stay on task. Then it shows how the interface of the program will be fun to use on a desktop too. </p>
