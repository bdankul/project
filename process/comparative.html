        <h2>Transfer Tool</h2>
        <img src="davis-transfer.png" alt="uc davis website" width="100%">
        <p>The entire UC Davis website was redesigned recently and it's looking good. There's really good visual heirarchy throughout the site, from the interactivity of the main nav to the separation of content displayed. The design is cohesive and feels fresh and welcoming. The typeface is friendly and easy to read. Overall the website is great but because it is a webpage under the huge umbrella that is the UC Davis website, it is broad and only provides links to links to other links. Often the user has to read through a lot to find what they need and may even get lost and lose track after a while. </p>
        <p>The Transfer Tool will help prospective transfers sort through all the information and provide a plan, geared with checklists and alerts, for students to follow. </p>

        <h2>Awesome Note</h2>

        <p>Awesome Note is an awesome notetaker, checklist maker, and organizer. It combines many different types of documents &#40that are often their own separate entities like the notes, calendar, and reminder apps on your phone&#41 into one aesthetically pleasing desktop. My favorite part about it was the amount of customization available. You could change the overall theme, the folder's colors and icons, and the pages and font. The design is clean and colorful.</p>
