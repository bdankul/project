        <p>This is pretty much the same layout as my Library Full of Interface exercise. The main page is pretty much an empty page full of widgets. Most of the rectangular menus will be hidden but visible when hovered over or clicked. An example of how a user would customize each widget is by the clock. When a user hovers over a widget a paintbrush and palette icon would appear and when they click that, the customization menu appears.</p>
