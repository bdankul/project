        <h1>Topic Choice</h1>
        <h2>Practical: UC Davis Transfer Tool</h2>
        <p>A site where prospective transfer students can log in, manage and track their transfer progress. The main profile page for students would include things like checklists that they could manage on their own and a calendar with highlighted dates of deadlines and such. The site would also alert students of such important dates by sending emails to them. The site would be a center where all available transfer resources are pooled in an interactive and easy to understand layout. </p>
        <h2>ISEA: Visual time machine of UC Davis</h2>
        <p>A phone application where students can view vintage images of Davis from where they stand. The application would make use of a map that shows spots where a photo was taken. The user could then orient their phones and see the image along with a description. The app would tell them which way to face so that they can compare the photo with the present day frame.</p>
