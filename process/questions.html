        <h1>Clarifying Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>At first I wanted to specifically make a tool for transfers (since I am a transfer myself), but i've come to find that my interests drive me more towards a more general organizational tool. Is this something that the under grad office would still be interested in? </li>
            <li>Do you think students would benefit from using this kind of organizational tool?</li>
            <li>Do you have any ideas or suggestions to make this project an even better resource for students?</li>

        </ol>
